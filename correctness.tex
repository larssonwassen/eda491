\section{Firewall Correctness}
\label{sec:correctness}

\inlinetodo{Explain which tool you used and how it helped you in verifying your firewall configuration. Elaborate on why the firewall is correctly configured and does what it should do. E.g., by trying the command XXX, we found that there are only YYY number of packets returned when pinging the host. Thus, the ping protection (rule Z) is working. \\
Also answer:\\
-- Why is the order of your firewall rules correct and makes sense?\\
-- Is your configuration stateful?}
