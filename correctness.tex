\section{Firewall Correctness}
\label{sec:correctness}

The verification process is important. If the firewalls correctness can't be assured, the system behind the firewall can be endangered. To verify that our firewall configuration was correct, we attacked the system hosting the firewall from a computer on the same local network.

\inlinetodo{Explain which tool you used and how it helped you in verifying your firewall configuration. Elaborate on why the firewall is correctly configured and does what it should do. E.g., by trying the command XXX, we found that there are only YYY number of packets returned when pinging the host. Thus, the ping protection (rule Z) is working. \\
Also answer:\\
-- Why is the order of your firewall rules correct and makes sense?\\
-- Is your configuration stateful?}
