This is the LaTeX template for the Network Security Course Lab 2.

-- Building on lab computers --

To build this document on the Chalmers Linux System, you need to source
(include) the LaTeX environment, which sets up the correct paths:

Run "source /chalmers/sw/unsup/texlive/bashrc.inc" in your bash shell.


-- Building on private machines --

This tarball ships a binary of biber (a bibtex replacement, version 1.8), which
is used in the makefile. This should work on the lab computers, but may lead to
problems on your private machine, if you have a different latex version
installed. In that case simply remove the bin/ before biber in the Makefile to
use the locally installed version.
