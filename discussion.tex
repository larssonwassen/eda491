The firewall configuration made is not wisely to actually use. It was made purely to give insight in how to configure this perticuilar type of firewall while allowing access to the perticular services specified in this report. blah blah

The testing did not cover all the defined firewall rules. Rules that were not covered was rules concerning IP spoofing and malformed TCP headers. They were not tested due to that we followed the \lab PM and only run the \texttt{nmap} command to recive the open and closed ports of the system. Unfurtenatly, we did not really look through that we had verified all the rules, only that we got the wanted output from \texttt{nmap}. If we would have done the lab again the onmitted rules would have been tested through other \texttt{nmap} commands. 

If we did test the IP spoofing we would probaly see that they were not that great.

This implies that is it hard for a novise to configure a firewall.

\inlinetodo{Reflect on the current firewall configuration. E.g., is it complete? What have you learned? Recommendations for future configuration, maintenance requirements of the firewall, etc.}
