\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}

The purpose of the \lab is to give an introduction to the concept of network firewalls. In the assignment we set up and configured a firewall in Linux by defining the firewall rules. To ensure the correctness of the firewall a computer in the same local network launched various attacks against the computer hosting the configured firewall. 

The report is organized as follows. In section~\ref{sec:setup} the setup for the assignment is described, including the default firewall settings here at chalmers. The following section, section~\ref{sec:config}, hold a description of the final firewall configuration and section \ref{sec:correctness} describes how the correctness of the firewall was ensured. Section \ref{sec:discussion} holds a reflection about the final firewall configuration and the \lab as whole. Lastly, section \ref{sec:conclusion} contain a brief conclusion.
