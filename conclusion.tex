\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}
The purpose of this \lab{} was to gain an basic understanding on the concept of network firewalls and even though some rules were not verified, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, and that we had some problems it feels like the purpose have been met. We can now afterwards say that a firewall that previously felt like somthing abstract and really hard to understand have now become manageable in terms of understanding. Also the fact that it is hard to config a perfect firewall in terms of security and usability have become obvious, you almost always have to make a tradeoff and it is easy to miss something. Especially when configuring a firewall for example huge networks with many hosts, servers and firewalls. Concerning the tool \texttt{iptables} that have been used to config the linux firewall we have seen that it is a increadibly powerfull and versatile tools that with the right configuration can protect from the most.
